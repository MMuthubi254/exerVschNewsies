        <h1>Relieving Students</h1>
        <p>Here’s a careful calculation that college students make at the beginning of each semester, one that might take a few weeks to fully suss out. Will I really need to buy textbooks for these classes? Are there any I can avoid purchasing at all?

            That should come as no surprise, considering a recent CollegeBoard survey calculated that undergrads spent $1,240 on average for books and supplies during the 2020-21 academic year. That figure was $220 higher for two-year college students. 

            But thousands of students are starting the semester without having to worry about course material expenses at all. Some institutions are removing the burden by providing free textbooks to their entire undergraduate student body一and also for graduate students, in some cases.</p>
